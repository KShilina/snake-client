# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from [here.](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) 

## Project Outcomes
- Develop familiarity with asynchronous programming
- Create TCP clients using Node's built-in net module
- Separate concerns by creating modules for different functionalities
- Build a client application in the form of a game that is run on your terminal

##Learning Outcomes
- Explain the difference between Client and Server code/responsibilities.
- Use TCP to create a simple client/server implementation in Node.

## Work Outcomes
- Troubleshoot and debug problems associated with web development.
- Demonstrate problem solving skills by developing basic algorithms to solve coding challenges or katas.
- Evaluate or analyze coding solutions / ideas, and their limitations and/or benefits.
- Discuss components that make up a web application at the "application layer".
- Contribute to full-stack web applications using modern software development patterns, tools and workflows:
- Integrate into common development team workflows (git, github workflow, automated testing, and code reviews).

## Final Product

## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.


## Instructions how to play
**Use "wasd" keys on your keyboard to move the snake to different directions:**

- **w**: *Move: up* :arrow_up:
- **a**: *Move: left* :arrow_left:
- **s**: *Move: down* :arrow_down:
- **d**: *Move: right* :arrow_right:
- **m**: *Say: It's me!* (to trigger a special message)
